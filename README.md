# 👋 Hi, I’m Chartreuse

> **“I deliver results cleaner than your desk — unless you actually clean your desk, in which case, we’re tied.”**

### 🧠 Philosophy
I believe technology should feel like an *extension of thought* — seamless, intuitive, and a little magical.  
I don’t just build tools; I craft **systems that think with you**. Every line of code is a quiet agreement between problem and solution, designed to get out of your way while doing exactly what you need.
